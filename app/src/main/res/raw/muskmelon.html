<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Major Cantaloupe Grown States in India:-</strong></span> Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh,&nbsp; Punjab, Maharashtra, &nbsp;Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.</p>

<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>High Yielding Improved Varieties of Cantaloupe in Indi<span style="color: #0000ff;">a</span>:-&nbsp;</strong></span>Hara Madhu, Annamalai,Lanow safed, Haribhari,Pusa Asaarbati, Punjab sunahari,Arka rajhans, Durgapura Madhu and Arka Jest.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Climate Required for Cantaloupe Farming<span style="color: #0000ff;">:-</span></strong></span> The Cantaloupe/Muskmelon crop grows best in hot and dry climatic conditions and this fruit is cultivated as summer crop. Good sunshine and high heat make the melon to have good sugar content. This fruit crop is highly susceptible to frost conditions.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Soil Requirement for Cantaloupe Farming: –</span></strong> Musk melon/Kharbooj can be cultivated on wide range of soils. However, its cultivation is best suited on sandy loam/&nbsp;light-textured, warm, well-drained soils with high in organic matter. High yield with good flavour can be expected with soil pH 6.0 to 7.0. Soil temperature below 15°C slows the seed germination and growth.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Land Preparation in Cantaloupe Farming:- </strong></span>2 to 3 ploughings is required to bring the soil to fine tilth and wed free. This can be done tractor or local/country plough.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Propagation and Sowing Method in Cantaloupe Farming:-</span></strong> Propagation is done by seeds. Make sure soil has good warmth condition for better germination. These fruit seeds take 3 to 5 days for germination.</p>
<p>There are four methods of sowing in musk melon cultivation.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Deep Pit Method:</strong> This method is best for river bed sowing. With 60 to 70 cm diameter &amp; 1.0 to 1.5 m. depth of circular pits should be dug at a distance 1.6 to 2.5 meter distance in both ways.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Shallow Pit Method:</strong> In this sowing method, dig the pits of 60 cm X 60 cm X 50 cm at a distance of 1.5 meter to 3 meter. Should fill the each pit with mixture of farm yard manure (5 kg) and soil, 40 grams of Urea, 50 grams of Phosphate &amp; 100 grams of Potash. Once pits are filled, make the circular basins for sowing the 6 seeds/basin at the depth of 3 cm. Cover the seeds with soil with little Farm Yard Manure or any other well rotten compost.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Mound Method</strong>: In this method of planting, musk melon seeds are sown on the mounds. In this method an average seed rate per acre is 1.5 kg. row-to-row spacing is 300 to 325 cm and plant-to-plant spacing is 90 to 100 cm. For better seed germination, treat the seeds with 2 percent of HCL.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Ridge Method:</strong> In this method, the musk melon seeds are sown on sides of raised beds.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Sowing Season in Cantaloupe Farming:-</span></strong> The cantaloupe seeds are sown from Nov to Dec in south India, Bihar &amp; West Bengal. In plains, seeds are sown from Nov to Mar and in hills, seeds are sown from April to May.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Seed Rate in Cantaloupe Farming:-</span> </strong>Seed rate depends on the size&nbsp; and shape of the seed. An average seed rate in <a href="http://www.agrifarming.in/tag/muskmelon-farming/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with muskmelon farming">muskmelon farming</a> is about 3 kg/hectare.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Manures and Fertilizers in Cantaloupe Farming:-</strong></span> Spread about 60 cart loads of Farm Yard Manure (FMY) or any other compost as part of soil/land preparation. Other fertilizers, NPK ratio should be 80:40:40 kg/ha should be applied. Half dose of Nitrogen and full does of Potash &amp; Phosphorus should be applied at the time of seed sowing. Remaining 1/2 dose of Nitrogen should be applied after 30days of sowing.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Irrigation in Cantaloupe Farming:-</strong></span> Irrigation should be given immediately after sowing the seeds in the field. Subsequent irrigations may be given @ 10 days interval to maintain the good soil moisture. Crops cultivated on river beds or in rainy conditions, may not need irrigation. Avoid water logging in the field by make soil with good internal drainage.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Weed Control in Cantaloupe Farming:-</strong></span> During the early stage of musk melon crop, give 3 to 4 hoeing to control the weeds and retain the soil moisture.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Pests and Diseases in Cantaloupe Farming:- </strong></span>Most common pests and diseases in Musk melon farming are: &nbsp;Aphids, <a href="http://www.agrifarming.in/tag/cucumber/">Cucumber</a> beetles, Cutworms, Root knot nematode, Southern blight (Stem and fruit rot), Fusarium wilt, Gummy stem blight, Anthracnose (Leaf spot, Fruit rot), Alternaria leaf spot, Charcoal rot, Downy mildew, Powdery mildew, Angular leaf spot, Bacterial wilt, Mosaic, Cabbage looper, Thrips, Squash bug. To control this appropriate action should be taken at various levels it also depends on the area/region cultivated. For more information on pests and diseases control in Cantaloupe farming, contact your nearest <a href="http://www.agrifarming.in/tag/agriculture/">agriculture</a> department.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Harvesting of Cantaloupe:-</strong></span> &nbsp;To get good quality of fruits, they should be harvested in right time. Cantaloupe or Musk melon fruits are ready for harvesting when the fruit external colour is changed. Clear sign of maturity in most melon varieties is when the rind changes colour from grey or green to yellow. Normally these fruits mature in 85 days to 115 days depending on the variety and climatic condition.</p><div class="code-block code-block-10" style="margin: 8px 0;">
