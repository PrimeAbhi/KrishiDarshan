<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Suitable Soil for Groundnut Farming :</strong></span></p>
<p>Groundnut is perfectly grown in a well-drained sandy loam, or sandy clay loam s oil. Deep well-drained soils with a pH of 6.5-7.0 and high fertility, are ideal for groundnut. An optimum soil temperature for good germination of groundnut is 30°C. Low temperature at sowing delays germination and increases seed and seedling diseases. Soil test must be done before starting a groundnut farming.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Crop rotation in Groundnut Farming</strong></span>: A crop rotation is very important in groundnut farming , this helps in efficient nutrient utilization and reduces soil borne diseases and nematodes. It also helps to reduce the incidence of weeds. <a href="http://www.agrifarming.in/tag/maize/">Maize</a>, <a href="http://www.agrifarming.in/tag/sorghum/">sorghum</a>, <a href="http://www.agrifarming.in/tag/pearl-millet/">pearl millet</a> or small grain crops can be grown following groundnut. To reduce the incidence of soil borne diseases it is recommended not to grow groundnut after groundnut, or tobacco, or cotton.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Application of Manures and Fertilizers in Groundnut Farming :</strong></span></p>
<p>In Groundnut farming, a balanced fertilizer application, based on soil tests, should provide adequate levels of especially phosphorus, potassium, calcium, sulphur, and magnesium . Nutrient availability depends on soil pH , organic matter content, and rate of release of nutrients from the soil minerals. The availability of other essential ions such as copper, boron, iron, manganese, and nitrogen may be low in alkaline soils (pH &gt;8.5); while an acid soil (pH &lt;6) may be deficient in molybdenum, manganese, sulphur, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and calcium. Therefore, depending on soil nutrient status and&nbsp; targeted yields</p><div class="code-block code-block-9" style="margin: 8px 0;">

<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Manure Application in Ground Farming:</strong></span></p>
<p>In Groundnut farming, application of 1 0 – 1 2 t ha-1 of chicken manure or 20 t ha-1 of well decomposed farm yard-manure should be used and completed at least 1 month before sowing. This should be mixed into the soil for good plant development and to improve the soil structure.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Fertilizers Application in Groundnut Farming: </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">The main Fertilizer components in Groundnut Farming are&nbsp; Nitrogen,Phosphorus, Potassium ,Calcium , Sulphur , Iron ,Zinc.</span></span> Deficiencies of boron , copper, molybdenum, manganese and magnesium&nbsp; can be corrected by soil application of these nutrients when symptoms appear, depending on soil type and agroclimatic conditions.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Sowing Preparation in Groundnut Farming :</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Plot design:</strong></span>When&nbsp; testing for yield a n d quantitative characters, treatments are to be randomized and arranged in the plots in blocks. The plot size is four rows of 4m length, with 30 cm between rows and 10 cm between plants.<strong><br>
</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Seed and Layout Preparation in Groundnut farming :</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #339966;"><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Initial steps:</strong></span></span> The experimental field maps indicating the randomization of treatments, blocks, direction of rows, number of rows, row width, row length, and alley width are prepared. Next, the seed and fertilizer packets for each&nbsp; row are prepared.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Selection of seed: </strong><span style="color: #000000;">Bold and well-filled pods are s elected for shelling about one week before sowing. The viability of the kernels may deteriorate after being shelled and stored for a long time a n d are more subject to storage pest damage. The plants produced from bold kernels were found to be superior to those from correspondingly smaller kernels in their rate of emergence, number of successful seedlings, number of primary branches and leaves, and dry mass of roots, shoots, total dry matter, and pod yield.<br>
</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Seed treatment:</strong><span style="color: #000000;">To control pathogens causing seed and seedling diseases, it is necessary to coat the seed before sowing with either Thiram® (a.i. 5 0 % @ 3 g kg -1 seed) or Bavistin® (a.i. 5 0 % @ 2 g kg’ 1 seed). Seed may be inoculated at the time of sowing by field inoculation to ensure good nodulation where a soil has been found to contain few rhizobia.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #008000;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Seed rate and spacing</strong></span>. The seed rate depends on the variety (Spanish, Valencia, o r Virginia), runner or bunch type, the seed mass, and germination rate of the seed-lot . The recommended population for bunch varieties is 330 000 plants ha -1 (about one plant per 30 x 10 cm). &nbsp;In case of semi spreading and spreading varieties the recommended population is 250 000 plants ha -1 (one plant per 40 x 10 cm).&nbsp;</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Seed&nbsp; packets:</strong></span><span style="color: #000000;"> When sowing by hand is done the calculated a m o u n t of seed for each row is separately packeted and the packets for each plot are temporarily fastened together. In case of machine sowing, seed packets are arranged by groups of rows for continuous sowing.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Sowing in Groundnut Farming :</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Groundnut sowing during the rainy season start with the onset of the rains, usually by the 3rd week of June.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Examine the soil before sowing for an optimum moisture content after rainfall or give a presowing irrigation to make sure good germination .</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">At the time of sowing, place the seed at 5-6 cm depth in the soil. Compact the soil around the seed to ensure there is firm contact with soil moisture for rapid and uniform germination. Use of a seed drill with packing wheels is useful to ensure uniform germination.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">When sowing manually, make sure that plots in each block is completed by the same person to reduce within-block variation due to uneven sowing caused by human differences.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Irrigation in Groundnut Farming :</strong></span></p>
<figure id="attachment_365" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-365" src="files:////android_res/raw/groundnutfarmingsprinkler.jpg" alt="Groundnut farming sprinkler irrigation" width="300" height="184" ></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Groundnut farming sprinkler irrigation.</figcaption></figure>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Groundnut yields will be reduced if the upper soil zone becomes dry from f lowering through pod development. A water deficit may lead to the following consequences.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Reduction in the dry matter production of vegetative components as well as the crop growth rate. Fewer and smaller leaves with small compact cells and shorter stems. Water deficit from sowing to 67 days delays the period of rapid fruit growth by 10 days and decreases yield.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Water deficit during the flowering and pegging stages results in higher yield losses than stress at any other growth stage; This deficit reduces the number of f lowers plant-1.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Water deficit in the soil surface during peg formation and pod development reduces pod number and pod yield.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Water deficit in the fruiting zone results in unfilled pods , and less calcium concentration in the hull and seed .</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Water deficit reduces groundnut quality, shelling percentage or percentage of sound mature seeds, seed mass, and germination of seed.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="color: #008000;">The aim&nbsp; of irrigation is to prevent soil water deficit and to supply the crop’s upper rooting zone with sufficient moisture without water logging the root zone.</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Adequate available water in the upper 60 cm layer of soil is important for high yield and good quality groundnut seeds. Most s oils when at field capacity will hold about 3.1 cm of water at 30 cm of depth. The highest groundnut yields are observed when available soil moisture is kept above 50 % of field capacity. Therefore, sprinkler irrigation is recommended when the moisture has been depleted to 50 % of field capacity in the top 60 c m . During peak water-use periods (0.6-0.7 cm day-1) the field m a y require 3.0-3.5 cm of water every 5 days. Irrigation intervals can be prolonged for 7-10 days during periods of low daily water requirements.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">An optimum water management scheme is to schedule sprinkler irrigation to maintain a less than 50 % SWD (soil water depletion) level in the top 30 cm of soil during early growth stages. Imposing a moderate water deficit during pre-f lowering phase followed by irrigation can increase pod yields by 18 – 20 %. However, irrigation should be made at 2 5 % SWD during the pod-formation and seed-development st ages. If the soil water potential is measured , irrigation should be maintained the soil water potential above -0.6 bars.When long, dry, hot, periods occur at the sensitive growth stages, such as pegging, pod format ion, and early pod filling, sprinkler irrigation are necessary to maintain the soil water potential above -0.25 to -0.50 bars . This means that the upper 30 cm of soil should appear and feel moist and the plants should not wilt from lack of moisture during the afternoon.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Weed Control in Groundnut Farming :</strong></span></p>
<p>Weeds cause much damage to the groundnut crop during the first 45 days of its growth. The most critical period of weed competition is from 3-6 weeks after sowing. The average yield loss due to weeds is about 30 % ,whereas under poor management yield loss by weeds may be 60 %. Therefore, it is advantageous to mechanically and chemically control weeds during the initial 6 weeks of groundnut growth.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Harvesting in Groundnut Farming :</strong> </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_364" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://agrifarming.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/groundnut_farmers1.png" target="_blank"><img class="size-medium wp-image-364" src="file:////android_res/raw/groundnutfarmers.png" alt="groundnut farmers" width="300" height="139" ></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">groundnut farmers.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Premature harvesting of groundnut pods lowers the yield, oil percent age, and quality of seeds. Delay in harvesting after physiological maturity can result in increased Aspergillus flavus infection, and aflatoxin contamination in pods/seeds, and many pods may be left in the soil due to weakening of pegs. The Spanish bunch varieties (nondormant types) start germinating if harvesting is delayed. Therefore, it is important to harvest at optimum maturity.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #008000;">There are three ways of harvesting in Groundnut Farming :</span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Apply sprinkler irrigation for an hour and manually pull the plants.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Provide a light surface irrigation 2 – 3 days before harvest a n d use a blade harrow that cuts the plant roots 1 2 – 1 5 cm below the soil surface. Then manually pull the plants.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">W h e n irrigation water is scarce, use a plow or tractor-driven digger to loosen the soil. Then manually remove the plants.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Harvested plants should be stacked in the field for a few days for air and sun drying (on bright sunny days) before stripping the pods. Thereafter, pods are continuously dried to reach a moisture content of 6 – 6 % to avoid the development of aflatoxin caused by yellow mold (Aspergillus flavus). On cloudy days, pods should be removed and immediately placed in an air drier at 27-38°C for 2 days or until the pods dry to a constant mass ( 6 – 8 % moisture).</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Storage of Groundnut:</strong></span></p>
<p>After cleaning and grading, store the dry pods in gunny bags and stack them up to 10 bags high in separated stacks so that air freely circulates among them . The bags should be piled on wooden planks to avoid damage from dampness. Dusting the bags with 5% Lindane® will protect the pods from many storage pests
