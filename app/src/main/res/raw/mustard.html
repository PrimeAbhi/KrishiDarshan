Mustard thrives well in dry and cool climate, therefore mustard mostly grown as Rabi season crop. Mustard crop requires the temperatures between 10<strong>°C</strong> to 25<strong>°C</strong>.Mustard crop is grown in the areas receiving 625 -1000 mm yearly rainfall. This crop does not tolerate frost, so it requires clear sky with frost free conditions.</p>

Medium to deep soils with good drainage is best suitable for mustard cultivation. Soil ideal pH range for Mustard is 6.0 to 7.5.Make sure to carry out a soil test to find out the soil properties like soil type, strength and nutritious levels.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Preparation of Land in Mustard Farming:-</strong> </span>1 to 2 ploughings and two harrowing should be given as part of field preparation. For second crop cultivation, field should be prepared by giving 2 crosswise harrowing after kharif crop.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Seed Treatment in Mustard Farming:-</span> </strong>Seeds should be treated with thiram at 3 grams per kg of mustard seed to protect the plants from seed diseases.</p>

<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Sowing methods and seed rate in Mustard Farming:- </strong></span>Mustard usually sown in Sept – Oct months. If mustard crop as pure one, it should be sown by drilling method or if this crop as mixed crop, seeds should  be sown by broadcasting or drilling method.mix the seeds with fine sand for uniform spacing. For better germination, seeds should be sown maximum of 6 cm depth in the soil. Make sure there is enough moisture present in the soil when seeds are sown.</p>
<p>In pure mustard crop seed rate could be about   4 &#8211; 6 kg per hectare.</p>
<p>in mixed crop seed rate could be about               2 &#8211; 3 kg per hectare.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Spacing in Mustard Farming:-</span> </strong>Spacing of plants should be about 45 cm x 20 cm.</p>

After 1 month of sowing, 20 to 25 kg N per hectare should be applied as top dressing.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Irrigation in Mustard Farming:-</strong></span> Pre-soaking irrigations should be given before sowing the seeds. 3 irrigations should be applied @ 4 weeks interval after sowing the seeds.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Weed control/Inter culture operations in Mustard Farming:-</strong> </span> 2 to 3 weeding  &amp;  2 hoeing should be given @ 2 weeks interval. Thinning should be done after 2 weeks time interval( in case of pure mustard crop). In cased of mixed crop, mustard crop receives from the inter cultivation given to main crop.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Harvesting of Mustard:-</strong></span>  Harvesting should be carried out as soon as the pods begins to turn yellow color &amp; seed becomes hard.
