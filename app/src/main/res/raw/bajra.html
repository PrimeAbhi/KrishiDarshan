<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Agro-climatic requirement for Bajra Cultivation:- </strong></span>Bajra grows well in dry and warm climatic conditions and it’s drought&nbsp; tolerant crop which requires low annual rainfall ranging between 40 cm to 60 cm. Ideal temperature for bajra cultivation is between 20 °C to 30 °C. Moist weather is advantageous during its vegetative growth. In North India, bajra is grown as kharif crop and in some southern parts is grown as summer crop providing Irrigation.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Soil Requirement for Bajra&nbsp;Cultivation:-</span> </strong>Bajra can be grown in wide range of soils. However, It thrives best in black cotton soils, sandy loam soils having well drainage. This crop does not prefer acidic and water logging soils. Avoid saturated soils for its cultivation. It grows successfully well in soils with low pH (or) high salinity. Bajra can be easily grown in regions where other cereal crops like <a href="http://www.agrifarming.in/tag/wheat/">wheat</a> or <a href="http://www.agrifarming.in/tag/maize/">maize</a> would not survive.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Land or Field Preparation in Bajra Cultivation:-</strong> </span>2 to 3 harrowing followed by a ploughing is required to make the soil in the field to the fine tilth. Any weeds should be destroyed during the field preparation to accommodate proper sowing and distribution of seed at appropriate depth.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Seed treatment in Bajra Cultivation:-</strong></span> The organo mercurial compound Ceresan, Agrosan should be used @ 2 – 3 kg per hectare to control seed borne diseases.</p>

<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Seed rate and Spacing in Bajra Cultivation:-</strong> </span>Seed rate and spacing in bajra cultivation as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">3 to 3.5 kg/ha for dibbling method.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">5 to 5 kg/ha for drilling method.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Row spacing of 40 cm to 45 cm should be maintained and within rows, 10 cm – 15 cm should be kept.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Sowing time in Bajra Cultivation:-</strong> </span>Ideal time for Bajra sowing time is middle to last week of July month.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Weed control &amp; Inter cultural&nbsp;Operations in Bajra Cultivation:-</span> </strong>Gap filling or Thinning is followed,&nbsp; Applying &nbsp;Atrazine @ 0.5 kg/ha works well to control weeds.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Manures and Fertilizers in Bajra Cultivation:-</strong> </span>Even Bajra requires less nutrients, If you are cultivating commercial hybrid bajra, adding Farm Yard Manure (F.M.Y) or Compost result in better yield and quality of seed. Apply these organic manures at the time of soil or land preparation so that soil will become fully decomposed by the time of sowing. 90 –100 kg of N: 50-60 kg of &nbsp;P: 50-60 kg&nbsp;of&nbsp;K is recommended for hybrid variety.</p>
<p>Fertilizers should be applied in split doses. At the time of sowing, full phosphorus and potash and half of nitrogen should be added as basal application. 1/4 th nitrogen should be added after 30 and 60 days (after sowing).</p>
