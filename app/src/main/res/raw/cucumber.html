(Plant spacing). Two to three cucumber seeds are sown in each pit. Layout in Ring &amp; basing method is preferred.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #008000;">Manure and Fertilizers in Cucumber Farming :-</span></strong> 40 to 50 cartload well decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) should be added at the time of soil preparation. , 25 kg P/ha 50 kg N, Should be given ½ N and full phosphorus should be given at the time of sowing cucumber seeds and remaining half N should be given 30 days after sowing of seeds.</p>

Install drip system with main and sub-main pipes and place the inline lateral tubes at an interval of 1.5meter. Place the drippers in lateral tubes at an interval of 60 cm and 50 cm spacing with 4 LPH and 3.5 LPH capacities respectively. For summer crop irrigation should be given to maintain moisture and for rainy season crop irrigation is needed. &nbsp;For drip Irrigation advantages <span style="color: #ff0000;"><a style="color: #ff0000;" href="http://agrifarming.in/drip-irrigation-vs-sprinkler" target="_blank"><strong>Click here.</strong></a></span></p>
