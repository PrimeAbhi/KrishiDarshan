</div>

<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Soil Requirements for Asparagus Cultivation:-</strong></span> Asparagus can be grown in wide range of soils. However, well-drained soils rich in organic matter with pH 6.5 to 7.5 are ideal for its cultivation. If the soil is more acidic in nature, liming should be done. On heavy soils consider creating raised beds.</p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px 0;'>

<p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Propagation in Asparagus Cultivation:-</span> </strong>Asparagus can be propagated through crowns or seeds. Quality crowns can be selected from reputed nursery and transplant in the field. However, it can be grown from seed as well. Local suitable high yielding all-male hybrid variety seeds should be selected for sowing.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Land Preparation, Planting in Asparagus Cultivation:-</span> </strong>Carry out deep ploughing about 20 to 25 cm followed by 2 to 3 harrowing after few days. Make sure to remove any weeds from previous crops and proper levelling of the soil should be done. Prepare about 45 cm broad ridges for plantation leaving 20 cm furrow space as a channel for irrigation.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Nursery Raising and Planting in </strong><strong>Asparagus Cultivation:- </strong></span>Asparagus seeds should be sown in the month of April in raised beds at 5 cm apart to facilitate decay of its hard seed coat by the time monsoon enters. Germination starts in 7 to 10 days after the first shower of monsoon in June month. The seedlings should be transplanted on ridges at 60 cm x 60 cm apart and provided <a href="http://www.agrifarming.in/tag/bamboo/">bamboo</a> stakes as part of training.</p>

<p>Vegetative propagation is by division of rhizomatous disc present at the base of the aerial stem. The rhizomatous disc develops several vegetative buds around the aerial shoots. The disc is divided in such a way that each piece possessed at least 2 buds along with 2 to 3 tuberous roots. These pieces are planted conversing the buds with 1cm of soil followed by light irrigation. The sprouting should start in 8 to 10 days after plantation.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Training in Asparagus Cultivation:-</span></strong> To avoid the top-growth breaking in windy climate and damaging the crowns, use stakes and garden twine to make a fence either side of the row for supporting the crop.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Irrigation in Asparagus Cultivation:- </strong></span> Irrigation requirement depends on the soil type, climate and season. Generally irrigation should be given after monsoon is over. This crop requires 2 to 3 irrigations in winter season and 2 irrigations per month in summer season.

<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Intercultural Operations in Asparagus Cultivation:-</strong></span> Keep the asparagus beds weed free and carry out weeding by hand rather than with a hoe, as the shallow roots of the asparagus plants can be easily damaged. Two to Three weedings should be carried out during the rainy season and subsequent weeding should be done one in 2 to 3 months. <a href="http://www.agrifarming.in/tag/mulch/">Mulch</a> the beds to prevent weed growth and retain soil moisture. Usually, male plants produce more and better spears and most of the modern cultivars are all-male. Remove any female plants from the field. Female plants are easy to notice because they produce orange-red berries.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Manures and Fertilizers in Asparagus Cultivation:-</strong></span> In case of growing the plants for medicinal purpose, they should be cultivated without any chemical fertilizers and pesticides.

Cut individual spears with a sharp knife below the soil when they are no more than 18cm tall. In warm weather, harvest every two to three days for the best quality spears. These plants can be harvested after 40 to 42 months in winter. The roots of the plants should be dug-out and peeled off with the help of sharp knife immediately after harvesting.</p>
