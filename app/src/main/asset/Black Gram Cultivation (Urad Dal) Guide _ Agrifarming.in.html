style="user-select: text;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Introduction:-&nbsp;</strong></span>Black gram (Vigna Mungo L.) is popularly known as “Urad”, is one 

of the most&nbsp;important pulses crop, grown across India. The Urad crop is resistant to adverse climatic&nbsp;conditions and improve the soil fertility by fixing 

atmospheric nitrogen in the soil.</p>
<p>This crop is grown&nbsp;primarily for its protein rich seeds and used as daal and as main ingredient in breakfast 

snacks&nbsp;like dosa,idli, vada &amp; papad.</p>
<p style="user-select: text;"><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Local Names for&nbsp;Black&nbsp;Gram (Urad Dal) in 

India:-</span></strong>&nbsp;Urad Dal (Hindi), Minumulu (Telugu),Ulundu Paruppu (Tamil), Uzhunnu Parippu (Malayalam), Uddina bele (Kannada),&nbsp;Masakalai dala

class="wp-caption-text">Crop Calendar for Urad Dal-Black Gram.</figcaption></figure>
<p style="user-select: text;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Agro-Climate 

required in Black Gram Cultivation:-</strong> </span>This crop prefers dry whether condition with ideal &nbsp;temperature range between 25 C to 35 C. Maturity crop 

period should coincide with the dry &nbsp;whether condition for high yield and good quality seeds, this is one of the main criteria to decide&nbsp;time of 

planting.</p>
<p style="user-select: text;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Soil requirement in Black Gram Cultivation:-</strong> </span>Soil in Black Gram 

cultivation should have neutral pH.&nbsp;Loam or clay loam soils are best suited soils for it’s cultivation. Adding higher organic matter in&nbsp;soil will result in 

vigorous seed production.</p><div class="code-block code-block-9" style="margin: 8px 0;"></div>

<p style="user-select: text;"><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Selection of land and it’s Preparation in&nbsp;Black&nbsp;Gram Cultivation:-

</span></strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">&nbsp;</span>The field selected for seed&nbsp;production must not have been sown with black gram in the previous years. 

This is done to avoid&nbsp;volunteer plants that cause admixture. Fields continuously cultivated with black gram may harbour&nbsp;root rot or wilt pathogen.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Seed selection in Black Gram Cultivation:-</strong></span> Seeds used in sowing must be from an authorised&nbsp;source. Seeds 

must be genetically pure and having fine quality. Seeds used for sowing in Black&nbsp;Gram cultivation must also be vigorous so that we can obtain a good field stand. 

Seeds must be&nbsp;thoroughly checked for diseased seeds,hard seeds,shrunken,deformed seeds,and immature seeds.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Seed rate 

and Treatment in Black Gram Cultivation:-</strong></span> Seed rate depends on the variety the seed&nbsp;selected. Usually an average of 8 to 10 kg per acre is 

sufficient.</p>
<p style="user-select: text;">Black gram seeds should be treated&nbsp;with seed treating fungicide to reduce infection by fungal pathogens from the 

soil. Black gram&nbsp;seeds are treated with Bavistin 2 grams for every kg of seeds. Organic fungicide like Trichoderma&nbsp;viridi is also available for pulses @ 4 

grams/kg.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Sowing and Spacing in Black Gram Seed Cultivation:-&nbsp;</strong></span>The Black Gram seeds are sown @ 2 cm 

depth &nbsp;with a spacing of 10 cm and 30 cm between rows in main field.&nbsp;Irrigation management in Black Gram Cultivation:-&nbsp;Irrigation/Water management in 

Black Gram Cultivation:- Black gram crop is very sensitive to&nbsp;irrigation. Fields must be constantly monitored for any drought conditions. If this crop is not 

irrigated &nbsp;properly, pulse crop shed flowers. Plants without water produce seeds that are small and hard with &nbsp;low vigor. Because of this problem Black 

Gram&nbsp;crop must have sufficient water supply.</p>
<p>Field should be irrigated immediately after sowing followed by lite irrigation on 3rd day. 

Then,&nbsp;irrigation should be carried out based on the need (Usually when field becomes dry). Water supply&nbsp;during flowering of the crop, pod formation &amp; 

seed development must be provided for quality<br>
output.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Fertilizers in Black Gram cultivation:-</strong> </span>Basal 

fertilizers application alone may not be sufficient for&nbsp;the seed crop. It is mandatory to provide nutrition during the heavy growth of crop and 

seed&nbsp;formation period. The nutrient needed by the rapidly developing pulse seeds are provided&nbsp;through&nbsp;foliar feeding.</p>
<p>Nutrient solution 

preparation is done by soaking the following chemicals in water&nbsp;(100 lit). This solution is sprayed 25 to 35 days after seed sowing followed by another spray in 

40&nbsp;to 50 days.&nbsp;Below table lists the items for preparing nutrient solution.</p>

<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Weed control in Black Gram cultivation:-</strong> </span>Immediately after sowing and watering, Basalin 

weedicide&nbsp;is sprayed by dissolving 2 ml of Basalin/liter water. The weedicide spraying must be done within 3&nbsp;days of sowing. If it is done later, it can 

damage the crop. Applying weedicide will control the&nbsp;early growth weeds, to control later emerging weeds in the crop, manual weeding should be done&nbsp;after 2 

weeks.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Pests and Diseases in Black Gram cultivation:-</strong></span> The main pest in the Black Gram crop is stem 

fly.&nbsp;This pest affects the crop at the early stages by causing drying and withering plants. During the&nbsp;growth phase, major pests like leaf hopper, aphid, 

white fly affect the field crop. These pests<br>
should be controlled by spraying either dimethoate, phosphomidan or mehyldematan, @ 2&nbsp;ml/litre.</p>
<p>During the 

growing phases of the seed crop incidence of yellow mosaic can be observed. The affected crop&nbsp;shows yellow mottled symptoms. These plants can be rouged out as and 

when they are seen.&nbsp;White fly is the culprit in spreading &nbsp;this disease, removal of the affected plants is followed&nbsp;by an insecticide spray as mentioned 

above. Apart from this, black gram crop is also affected by&nbsp;root rot, wilt &nbsp;and these are to be removed and the affected area of the field &nbsp;should be 

sprayed using 0.1%&nbsp;Bavistin solution. Rarely the Black Gram crop is affected by Powdery mildew and it is noticed by the&nbsp;presence of white powder deposits on 

the leaves. Leaf spot of &nbsp;Cercospora &nbsp;can be noticed by the&nbsp;presence of brown spots. The Powdery mildew and cercospora can be controlled by spraying 

1%&nbsp;Bavistin solution.</p><div class="code-block code-block-10" style="margin: 8px 0;">

<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Harvesting of black gram crop:-</strong></span> The ripened pods can be collected from the plants in one or 

two&nbsp;pickings and dried on the floor. In case, If the&nbsp;&nbsp; plants come to &nbsp;harvest, then the crop &nbsp;should cut and &nbsp;the plants spread over the 

floor to dry. The plants becomes dry and turn into black and pods may start&nbsp;splitting. The plants should be beaten using pliable sticks to prevent damage to 

seeds. Then seeds&nbsp;are separated from pods. These plants after harvesting can be used as <a href="http://www.agrifarming.in/tag/fodder/">fodder</a> for 

animals.</p>

<p style="user-select: text;"><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Yield of&nbsp;Black&nbsp;Gram :</span></strong>– Basically Yield 

depends on the variety of seed selected and field management,&nbsp;with hybrid varieties it is possible to achieve yield form 800 kg -1100 kg /acre.</p>
